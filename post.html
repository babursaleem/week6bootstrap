              <p>Vince Lombardi's quote can be applied to all sports, all ages/levels and genders but some people would disagree with it. As a person who has grown up loving and playing sports competitively I could
                imagine playing for "fun" or receiving a "participation" trophy. Sports is designed to be competitive while teaching discipline and respect for your opponent. Now, not everybody practices these things and that
                is why people may disagree. If everybody is participating on the same level it can still be seen as friendly competition even if you are not a pro, the only way playing a sport without taking score would be acceptable
                is if you are competing with people that are not at the same level due to age, experience or gender but even then taking the score and let's say letting the 7 year old boy win is still better than not taking score at all.
                I say this because now you have instilled some confidence in this child who enjoys sports because it is competitive by nature. There are many other activities people can take part in that are strictly for fun with no or minimal competition. The rest is how an individual handles competition and beating or losing to their opponent or opponents.

                    <p>Playing sports and participating at a young age and up is such a special and important experience in life. Personally, I could not imagine my life without sports and I say that mostly because
                    of the friends I have made that will be life long friends by being on sports teams together. It does teach discipline, loyalty and teamwork and that is important for any human being no matter where you come from or what you do in life.
                    The object of this page is to have friendly discussions and mostly take something positive away from it and hopefully be able to apply what you have taken from it to your own life. Below are
                    some more of my favorite quotes from the world of sports. Enjoy!</p>
